# Linux 5 Week

*Reminder*: Linux is a multi-user system.

You can use '>' to save result as .txt file.

*For example,*
```
$ls -lh > file_list.txt
```
Save result of ```$ls -lh``` in file_list.txt

```
$ cat (file name)
```
Show text file's contents.  
Use '>>' when append, but if there is no file exists, then they create a new file.

*for example*: ```$ ls -lh >> file_list.txt```

Using '<' when you make output.  
You can use '<' and '>' at once.

example:
```
$ sort < words.txt > sorted_result.txt
```
â†‘ output saved in ***sorted_result.txt***

```

```
This charater is neither "I" nor "L", mostly you can enter this command nearby "Enter" in your keyboard.

```
print (text).

```

```
use this command when you enter command continuously.

r w x  
r: read
